							World Cancer Day is a global awareness day, observed on February
							4th, and is a perfect opportunity to spread the word about Cancer
							and its early detection, prevention, and treatment programs
							available to support the community. It is an initiative led by the
							<a
								href="https://www.uicc.org/what-we-do/convening/world-cancer-day"
								>Union of International Cancer Control (UICC)</a
							>
							to support the goals of the World Cancer Declaration mentioned in
							2008.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Prevention of cancer has become one of the major challenges to
							public health in the 21st century and plays a critical role in the
							fight against cancer. At least 40% of all cancer cases can be
							prevented with effective primary prevention measures, and further
							mortality can be reduced through early detection of Cancer/tumors.
						</p>
