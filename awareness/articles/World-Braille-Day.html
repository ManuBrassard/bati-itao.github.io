							Every year, January 4th is World Braille Day. It raises awareness
							on the importance of braille as a communication tool for people
							who are visually impaired. It is also celebrated on this day to
							honor the birth of the Braille inventor “Louis Braille”.
						</p>

						<p>
							Braille is a tactical writing system used by people who are
							visually impaired. Braille codes cover over 133 languages and 63
							dot patterns. These patterns have rectangular blocks called cells
							that have tiny bumps called raised dots.
						</p>

						<h2>Braille History</h2>

						<p>
							Louis Braille was a Frenchman who lost his eyesight at the age of
							3 when he accidentally stabbed himself in the eye with his
							father's awl. Soon infection spread all over his eyes leaving him
							completely visually impaired.
						</p>

						<p>
							His invention of reading and writing brought a revolution to the
							entire world and especially to those who were visually impaired.
							At the age of 15, he developed a military code “Ecriture Nocture”
							(night writing) for the French Military and invented special codes
							for musical scores in braille. He published his first book “The
							method of writing words, music, and plain songs by the means of
							Dots” in 1829. Later, he developed a system for Mathematics and
							Music.
						</p>

						<h2>Interesting facts</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Toys in Braille: The biggest classic family games, such as
								<a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/uno-braille-gmm14"
									>UNO</a
								>, <a href="https://www.legobraillebricks.com/">LEGO</a>, and
								<a href="https://braillecube.com/">Rubik's Cube</a> are
								available in Braille versions.
							</li>
							<li>
								Braille Tattoos: Most people get flat (ink) braille across
								<a
									href="https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/braille-tattoo-blind"
									>tattoos</a
								>, while others get small surgical beads inserted under their
								skin to create raised braille dots.
							</li>
							<li>
								Braille Asteroid: there is an Asteroid, that later NASA named it
								“9969 Braille” in honor of Louis Braille.
							</li>
							<li>
								Military Code “Night Writing”: This special writing was
								developed by French Army in 1819 to communicate at night without
								speaking or by using Candles.
							</li>
							<li>
								Accessible Canadian Currency:
								<a
									href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_currency_tactile_feature"
									>The Tactical feature</a
								>
								is the feature on Canadian banknotes to aid people who are
								visually impaired to identify the notes, designed by Susan
								Leaderman, a professor at Queen University.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Did you know that?</h2>
						<p>
							Within ESDC, the Information Technology Accessibility Office
							(ITAO) offers adaptive technology aids such as
							<a
								href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/"
								title="Job Access With Speech"
								>JAWS</a
							>,
							<a
								href="https://www.nvaccess.org/"
								title="NonVisual Desktop Access"
							></a
							>NVDA, and Braille Display. These devices are screen readers,
							which will either read aloud or display the text on the keyboard
							with raised dots.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you require adaptive technology support, please submit a
							<a href="https://a11yrmt.ca/openrequest-en.php">request</a> to the
							ITAO team.
						</p>
