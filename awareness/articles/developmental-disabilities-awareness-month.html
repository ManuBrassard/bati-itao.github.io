							March is Developmental Disabilities Awareness Month. The goal is
							to bring awareness about the disabilities, which impair the
							development of physical, learning, language, or behavior of the
							individual.
						</p>
						<p>
							These conditions begin during the developmental period, which may
							affect day-to-day functioning, and usually last throughout a
							person's lifetime.
						</p>

						<h2>Causes and risk factors</h2>
						<p>
							Developmental disabilities begin anytime during the developmental
							period and usually last throughout a person's lifetime. Most
							developmental disabilities begin before a baby is born, but some
							can happen after birth because of injury, infection, or other
							factors.
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Hearing loss among babies is due to maternal infections during
								pregnancy, such as
								<a
									href="https://cmvcanada.com/#:~:text=1%20in%20200%20Canadian%20infants%20are%20infected%20with,disability%20such%20as%20hearing%20loss%20or%20developmental%20delay."
									>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)</a
								>
								infection: complications after birth and head trauma.
							</li>
							<li>
								Some of the most commonly known causes of intellectual
								disability include
								<a
									href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder.html"
									>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder</a
								>
								and infections during pregnancy.
							</li>
							<li>
								Low birth weight, premature birth, multiple births, and
								infections during pregnancy are associated with an increased
								risk for many developmental disabilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								Untreated newborn jaundice can cause brain damage. They are more
								likely to have cerebral palsy, hearing and vision problems, and
								problems with their teeth.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Living with a developmental disability</h2>

						<p>
							People's abilities may be greatly affected by developmental
							disabilities. Symptoms can vary from one day to the next. Common
							issues faced may include:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Individuals suffering from hypervigilance can be easily alarmed
								and they may find noisy rooms uncomfortable. These also include
								motivational and behavioural symptoms such as irritability,
								inability to sit still, reduced self esteem, or an increased
								anxiety etc.;
							</li>
							<li>
								Cognitive issues such as poor short-term memory and limited
								ability to understand or having a hard time remembering complex
								routines.
							</li>
							<li>
								Their intellectual abilities are reduced, and they may have
								difficulty understanding complex instructions.
							</li>
						</ul>
