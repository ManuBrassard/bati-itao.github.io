            <p>National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) is an annual campaign that takes place every October to recognize and celebrate the contributions of workers with disabilities to the economy and society.</p>

            <p>The aim of NDEAM is to foster a society where individuals with disabilities have equal opportunities for employment and career advancement. To achieve this, various organizations and institutions join forces during this month to promote inclusion through education and training programs. These initiatives are designed to debunk misconceptions about disabilities and build awareness around the talents and abilities of individuals with disabilities.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">Do you know?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                NDEAM began in the United States after World War II, but in Canada it has been recognized more and more, across the country.
            </li>
            <li>
                National Disability Employment Awareness Month or NDEAM was first proclaimed in Canada in 2010 by the Province of Manitoba. Followed by Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, and New Brunswick.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2017/10/backgrounder_nationaldisabilityemploymentawarenessmonth.html">The Opportunities Fund for Persons with Disabilities</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/enabling-accessibility-fund.html">The Enabling Accessibility Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/news/2017/10/backgrounder_nationaldisabilityemploymentawarenessmonth.html">The Labour Market Agreements for Persons with Disabilities</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/portfolio/labour/programs/employment-equity/legislated.html">The Legislated Employment Equity Program</a> are all programs and initiatives which support people with disabilities. Canada aligns with government commitment to equality, human rights, social and economic well-being and makes sure that all Canadians Citizens have access to services and support.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another major step took by the Government of Canada is the <a href="https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-0.6/page-1.html">Accessible Canada Act</a> that came into force in 2019. This benefits persons with disabilities by proactively identifying, removing, and preventing barriers to accessibility.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Employers also play a crucial role in the success of NDEAM. By implementing inclusive hiring practices, businesses can tap into a diverse talent pool, as people with disabilities possess a wide range of skills and qualifications. Additionally, employing individuals with disabilities creates a more inclusive work environment that benefits all employees and enhances overall productivity.
        </p>

        <p>
            NDEAM is an ongoing campaign to promote disability employment inclusion throughout the year. ESDC is already paving its way by continuously working together to break down barriers and create opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate fully in the workforce.
