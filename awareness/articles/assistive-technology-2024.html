                <p>On the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) celebrates ongoing efforts to break down barriers and create an inclusive digital workplace. This day is a reminder that accessibility is about more than just meeting the needs of employees with specific needs; it is about continuously transforming the workplace to ensure that all employees have the resources, tools, and support they need to succeed.</p>  

                <p>A key part of this transformation is <strong>Adaptive and Assistive Technology (AAT)</strong>, which breaks down barriers in modern digital technology. AAT provides specialized devices, software, and equipment tailored to individual needs, helping to create a more inclusive experience for all employees in the workplace.</p> 

                <p>The IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) - Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACE) will be hosting an interactive in-person kiosk on December 3, 2024, from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. at Place du Portage, Phase IV, 1st Floor, 140 Promenade du Portage. They will showcase a selection of adaptive and assistive technology and will provide live demonstrations of these tools in action, highlighting their benefits for all employees, including those with disabilities.</p>  

                <h2>Did You Know That We All Use AAT Every Day?</h2>

                <p>Features like closed captions, spell checkers, dictation, read-aloud options, and night mode are just a few examples of how these in-built tools are seamlessly integrated into our digital world. AAT takes it one step further, offering more advanced solutions to support employees with specific needs, enabling them to perform their tasks more effectively and reducing any barriers.</p>

                <p>Whether you are an employee with specific needs or a manager supporting an employee with such needs, find out how AAT can enhance daily work experiences, and what ITAO tools and resources available are available to support employees and employers.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Employees may experience physical strain, such as repetitive stress injuries like carpal tunnel syndrome, and find it challenging to type or use a mouse.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If so, <strong>Dragon NaturallySpeaking Pro (DNSP)</strong>, a voice-recognition software, could be an interesting solution for them.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This tool is ideal for employees with <strong>mobility issues</strong>. It allows them to control their system vocally, making it easier to complete tasks like dictating emails, navigating their computer, or writing reports—by reducing physical effort and strain.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Employees who struggle with their memory or who find it difficult to focus may need extra help to stay organized and fully informed.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <strong>Echo Smart Pen</strong> can be a powerful ally. This tool records both audio and your handwritten notes simultaneously.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Employees with dyslexia, visual stress, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or low vision can struggle with eye strain, headaches, or discomfort from screen glare after long hours in front of their monitor.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tint and Track</strong> is a screen tinting and tracking tool designed to reduce eye strain and make it easier to work for extended periods. With adjustable tints and a built-in blue-light filter, it helps alleviate visual fatigue caused by prolonged screen use.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Some employees are multitaskers who struggle to stay focused or manage tasks due to specific needs. They may find it easier to listen to content rather than read it, so they can absorb information while staying productive.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA)</strong> is an option, and it is available to all ESDC employees. This screen reader converts text to speech, making it easier to navigate and interact with documents, emails, and web content.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You can obtain NVDA from the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/imit/nsd/index.shtml">National Service Desk</a>. This is especially beneficial for employees with <strong>visual or cognitive limitations</strong> like dyslexia or ADHD, and <strong>motor limitations</strong> such as repetitive strain injuries. It provides an accessible, hands-free way to interact with digital content.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
