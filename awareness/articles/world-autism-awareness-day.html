							Autism also known as
							<a
								href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/autism-spectrum-disorder-asd.html"
								>autism spectrum disorder-ASD,</a
							>
							is a lifelong neurological condition that starts during early
							childhood and continues into adulthood. World Autism Awareness Day
							is recognized annually on April 2 to spread awareness about the
							rights of people with autism throughout the world.
						</p>

						<h2>Autism and Mental Health conditions</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								People with autism often have co-occurring mental health
								conditions, including depression, anxiety, attention deficit
								hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder
								(OCD).
							</li>
							<li>
								It affects the entire human body and one of the co-occurring
								conditions that Autistic people are diagnosed with is epilepsy,
								a neurological disorder that results in “seizures” from abnormal
								circuit activity in the brain.
							</li>
							<li>
								As one-third of people with Autism have epilepsy,
								<a href="https://www.epilepsy.ca/what-is-epilepsy">Epilepsy</a>
								is one of the most common neurological disorders and affects 65
								million people worldwide, with 2.4 million new cases diagnosed
								every year.
							</li>
							<li>
								About a third of patients do not respond to medication despite
								the current availability of over two-dozen antiepileptic drugs,
								with an estimated 100,000 patients in Canada. Drug-resistant
								epilepsy is a serious chronic condition associated with a high
								risk for psychosocial impairment, cognitive decline, and
								mortality.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Facts</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								Though Autism and schizophrenia are different, some people live
								with both conditions. Before ASD became a separate diagnosis in
								1994, it was considered a part of schizophrenia spectrum
								disorder (SSD).
							</li>
							<li>
								In identical twins, if one child has autism, the other twin has
								about 90 % percent of developing an autistic disorder.
							</li>
							<li>
								People with autism face a high unemployment rate but Autistic
								individuals can present themselves with exceptional
								characteristics to code software. Software companies are active
								leaders in hiring people with autism into the workplace.
							</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							Despite the employment barriers, organizations can take steps
							toward adopting an inclusive environment by educating recruiters,
							leaders, and staff to break the myths about autistic employees.
						</p>

						<h2>Save the date!</h2>

							<strong>On April 4, 2023</strong>, Federal Public Speaker Sancho
