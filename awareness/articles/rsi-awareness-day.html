                <p>Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Awareness Day is observed every year on the last day of February.</p>
                <p>Catherine Fenech, who advocates for better workplace safety in Canada, started the annual observance in 2000. RSIs are a range of painful disorders that affect the tendons, muscles, nerves, joints, or spinal discs and are also known as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Common MSDs include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis and tension neck syndrome.</p>

                <h2>Facts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Workplace repetitive strain injuries affect about 15% of Canadians (over 5 million), according to Statistics Canada.</li>
                    <li>Poor posture or non-ergonomically designed workspaces, working in cold temperatures, carrying heavy loads, fatigue, and increases in psychological stress may contribute to the development of, or worsen the RSI.</li>
                    <li>Ergonomics in the workplace can assist in creating a more comfortable workstation, thus reducing stress and the potential for injury.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Who are at risk of functional neurological disorder?</h2>
                <p>People who have experienced psychological or physical trauma have a higher risk of developing FND.
                    This includes people having a history of childhood abuse, family dysfunction, anxiety, depression,
                    exposure to violence, physical injury, and infectious illnesses, etc. </p>
                <h2>Preventing RSI in the workplace</h2>
                <p>Occupations without the appropriate ergonomics can play an important role in developing RSIs. ESDC employees are provided with ergonomic information, tools, and equipment to prevent work-related ergonomic injuries, prevent muscle strain, and avoid awkward postures. Through the Departmental training and awareness activities, employees and managers should understand what may contribute to these injuries, how best to prevent them, and how to recognize the early signs and symptoms of RSIs.</p>
                <p>Employees and Managers are encouraged to review these tools, tips, and training available online at the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/hr/ohs/topics/ergonomics.shtml">Ergonomics</a> page and the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/hr/ohs/topics/coronavirus/guide-return-workplace/toolkit-employee.shtml">Toolkit for Employees</a> on iService. Please also speak to your manager if you have any ergonomic questions or concerns about your workstation setup.</p>
                <h2>Have you heard about the Ergonomics program at ESDC?</h2>
                <p>ESDC's <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/hr/ohs/topics/ergonomics.shtml">Ergonomics program</a> focuses on injury prevention and promotes a healthier and more productive workplace by minimizing the ergonomic risks that may contribute to musculoskeletal disorders and repetitive strain injuries. Ergonomics is the science that seeks to adapt the tools and tasks to fit the employee. It is about fitting the workplace to the worker. </p>
                <p>Employers must ensure workstations and equipment, the work environment and work procedures are in line with good ergonomic principles. It is up to employees to develop good ergonomic habits, maintain good posture, and organize their work activities effectively.</p>
                <p>As more employees begin to return to the office, it's a good time to remember the importance of achieving a good ergonomic set up both at home and in the office. </p>
                <p>In early 2022, ESDC's National Occupational Health and Safety Office (NOHSO) released their <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/hr/ohs/topics/ergonomic/good-ergonomic-setup.shtml">Achieving a Good Ergonomic Setup</a> video series. Each video focuses on a key area: your workspace, your desk and equipment, your chair, and micro-breaks and stretching. </p>
                <p>Be informed and direct yourself on how to eliminate discomfort in your workspace and prevent injuries.</p>

                    <li>Making minor adjustments to your workstation setup can often help prevent or eliminate ergonomic-related discomfort or prevent injuries. You can consult the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/hr/ohs/topics/ergonomics.shtml">Self-Adjustment Tools</a> on iService for tools and tips.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Increase your awareness about Ergonomics and learn to identify the factors that can contribute to MSD’S through training in <a href="https://esdc.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/CA1PRD0006/app/me/learningeventdetail;spf-url=common%2Fledetail%2Fcours000000000002666%3FfromAutoSuggest%3Dtrue">Saba</a>.</p>
                <p>In addition to the Occupational Health and Safety and ergonomic resources mentioned above, you should speak to your manager about any ergonomic-related concerns or needs you might have.</p>
                <p>Managers who require additional information should contact their Regional Occupational Health and Safety Advisor, through the <a href="https://iservice.prv/eng/managers/hrsc_about.shtml">Human Resources Service Centre</a>.</p>
