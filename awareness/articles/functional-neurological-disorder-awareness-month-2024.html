                <p>April is recognized as Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) Awareness Month. FND, also known as <a href="https://fndhope.org/fnd-guide/#:~:text=are%20movement%2Drelated.-,Conversion%20Disorder,-is%20a%20term">Conversion Disorder</a>, refers to a group of common neurological movement disorders that affect the functioning of the nervous system and cause the body and brain to miscommunicate. In the case of FND, this miscommunication is caused by the brain’s own inability to send and receive signals properly rather than by damage to the brain or by a particular disease.</p>

                <h2>Subtypes And Common Symptoms</h2>

                <p>The symptoms of FND can impact the quality of life of those affected in a manner similar to other neurological conditions. Subtypes of FND and symptoms typical of these conditions include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-limb-weakness/">Functional Limb Weakness</a>: Weakness in the arms or legs due to the malfunctioning of the nervous system.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-sensory-symptoms/">Sensory Symptoms</a>: Reduced sensation in a part of the body.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-dystonia/">Functional Dystonia</a>: Sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements or postures (e.g., clenched hands, twisted ankles). This occurs when the brain’s “map” becomes disrupted, causing the affected individual to perceive abnormal positions as normal.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-dissociative-seizures/">Functional Seizures</a>: Also known as dissociative or non-epileptic seizures, these disabling and frightening attacks look very similar to epilepsy or fainting spells.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-movement-disorders/">Functional Movement Disorders</a>: Include a range of distressing and disabling symptoms such as tremors, twitches, and spasms.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-cognitive-symptoms/">Functional Cognitive Symptoms</a>: Persistent cognitive difficulties, such as memory or concentration problems, that are not caused by diseases or damage to the brain. For many, these symptoms appear “out of nowhere.” According to one study of patients with suspected dementia, 24 percent were more likely to have a functional cognitive disorder rather than dementia. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-facial-symptoms/">Functional Facial Symptoms</a>: Occurs in episodes and typically affects one half of the face. For example, the lower half of the face or the corner of the mouth may be pulled down as a result of a muscle spasm.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-tremor/">Functional Tremors</a>: One of the common functional movement disorders. Functional tremors can cause uncontrollable shaking in parts of the body, usually in the arms or a legs. They are often mistaken for Parkinson’s disease.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/functional-speech-swallowing-symptoms/">Functional Speech Swallowing Symptoms</a>:  Include slurred speech, stuttering, and difficulty finding words.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://neurosymptoms.org/en/symptoms/fnd-symptoms/visuals-symptoms/">Visual Symptoms</a>: Include symptoms such as blurred vision, double vision, light sensitivity, and visual snow.</li>


                </ul>

                <h2>Who Is At Risk of Developing Functional Neurological Disorder?</h2>

                <p>Anyone can be affected by FND. However, it is more commonly diagnosed in women. Fundamental causes may involve biological factors (e.g. early childhood trauma and early life stress, anxiety, witnessing violence, maltreatment, or childhood sexual abuse) or sociological factors (e.g. Interpersonal relationships and stress).</p>
