                <h2>Embracing Neurodiversity</h2>
                <p>Neurodiversity is the concept that all our brains work in different ways. It refers to the recognition and acceptance of diverse neurological conditions such as ASD, dyslexia, ADHD, and other cognitive differences.</p>

                <h2>Understanding ASD and ADHD</h2>
                <p>ASD and AHDH are lifelong neurodevelopmental conditions in which autistic individuals may experience challenges with sensory processing, social communication, carrying out certain tasks, and emotional or behavioral regulations. Individuals with ADHD may have difficulties with concentration, short-term and working memory as well as planning and organization. They may be easily distracted by small things, act, or speak on the spur of the moment without thinking the consequences, and may find it difficult to control their emotions. Some people are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity; this is particularly the case for girls and women.</p>

                <h2>Quick Fact</h2>
                <p>Research shows that the brains of people with ASD operate differently. Most notably, they rely less on their verbal centers. For example, when non-autistic people look at an image, their brains are activated to process both visual and linguistic information. However, when an autistic individual looks at the same image, there is more activity in the visual information region of their brain than in the language region compared to a non-autistic person.</p>
                <p>This redistribution of brain function may be associated with superior performance in certain tasks.</p>

                <h2>Fostering Inclusivity through Strengthening Understanding of Neurodiversity</h2>
                <p>The concept of neurodiversity is the acceptance that all humans are different, with unique minds, needs, and abilities. This approach reaches beyond labels such as autism, dyslexia, or ADHD and recognizes that differences in ability are natural in humans and correspond to an individual’s unique gifts.</p>

                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <h3>Positive Attitude Towards Neurodiversity</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>In a 2022 Conference Board of Canada survey, most respondent displayed positive attitudes towards neurodiversity in the workplace. For example, both employees and managers, regardless of their neurodivergence, agreed that neurodiversity is beneficial to the workplace.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Challenges and Hesitancy</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Neurodiverse employees may hesitate to disclose their status as such due to the fear of being treated differently or of having their opportunities for career progression limited.</li>
                    <li>Because of a lack of awareness about neurodiversity, employers may not be well-equipped to provide neurodivergent employees with the understanding and support they need to succeed in the workplace, which poses barriers to neurodivergent employees.</li>
                </ul>
