                    <span style="font-size: 53%;">Upgrade Your Digital Vocabulary: Respectful Language Is the Latest Software Update for Inclusivity</span></h1>

                <p>Accessibility is not just about following the law. It is also about the language we use to communicate in digital spaces, social settings, and workspaces.</p>

                <h2>The Power of Words in the Digital Workplace</h2>

                <p>Words are powerful. Simply making a small change and using <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/disability/arc/words-images.html#:~:text=accurately%20and%20confidently.-,Good%20words%20to%20choose,-Table%201%3A%20Good">respectful language</a> in your digital interactions shows that you value each person’s individuality and dignity.</p>

                <p>Communications and digital products are at the heart of our daily operations. Use respectful language in your daily work to make a huge impact when you are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>writing emails, newsletters, documents, presentations, reports, and policies.</li>
                    <li>participating in Teams meetings or providing captions and transcripts.</li>
                    <li>writing captions and alt text for images;</li>
                    <li>creating web content; and</li>
                    <li>recording audio material. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Start Making a Difference</h2>

                <p>When accessible digital products and technologies are paired with respectful language, they become powerful tools for inclusivity. You can make a significant difference in creating an inclusive and respectful workplace by implementing the seven best practices listed below:</p>

                <h3>1.	Review Existing Content</h3>
                <p>Take a closer look at your current content and identify any outdated or disrespectful language. Replace it with respectful language.</p>

                <h3>2.	Use Clear and Simple Language</h3>

                <p>Make sure your documents, forms, labels, and instructions are written in plain, respectful language. Avoid jargon and complex or technical terms that might be confusing or exclude users with cognitive disabilities.</p>

                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <h5>Write</h5>
                    <p>“We value your contributions. Please submit your reports every two weeks. The guidelines provided will assist you in preparing reports effectively. This will help us achieve our shared goals.”</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <h5>Do Not Write</h5>
                    <p>“Please ensure that all bi-weekly reports are submitted in accordance with the established protocols and guidelines. Non-compliance may result in administrative action.”</p></div>

                <p>To learn more about how to tailor your document to your audience, see “<a href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/pecks-english-pointers/clarity-8-putting-it-plainly">Putting It Plainly</a>” on the <a href="https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/index">Resources of the Language Portal of Canada</a>.</p>

                <h3>3.	Provide Captions and Transcripts</h3>

                <p>Leverage the use of respectful language by providing captions and transcripts during all team meetings. This ensures that everyone, including employees with hearing impairments, can fully engage.</p>

                <h3>4.	Use Communications Tools Respectfully</h3>
                <p>Use respectful language in all your digital communications, such as emails, Teams chats, or when communicating with colleagues and clients.</p>

                    <h4>Example: Writing an email to your team</h4>



                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <h5>Write</h5>
                    

                    <p><strong>Subject: Accessibility Improvements for Our Website</strong></p>
                    <p>Dear Team,</p>
                    <p>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss some important updates regarding our <strong>website’s accessibility features</strong>. Our goal is to ensure that our site is <strong>inclusive and user-friendly for everyone, including persons with disabilities</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that all images have descriptive alt text to assist <strong>users who are blind or have low vision</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Improve keyboard navigation for <strong>users who cannot use a mouse</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Provide captions for all video content to <strong>support users who are deaf or hard of hearing</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let’s work together to make our <strong>website accessible to all</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Best regards,<br />
                    [Name]</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <h5>Do Not Write</h5>
                    

                    <p><strong>Subject: Website Changes for Disabled People</strong></p>
                    <p>Dear Team,</p>
                    <p>I hope this email finds you well.</p>
                    <p>I wanted to talk about some changes we need to make to our <strong>website to make it more accessible for disabled people</strong>. We need to make sure our site works for everyone, <strong>even those with disabilities</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Make sure all images have alt text for <strong>blind people</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Improve keyboard navigation for people <strong>who cannot use a mouse</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Add captions to videos for <strong>deaf people</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Let’s work together to make our <strong>website better for everyone</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Best regards,<br />
                    [Name]</p>
                    </div>

                <h3>5.	Include Alt Text for Images</h3>
                <p>Use alt text that describes the content and context of images. The language used should be respectful and informative.</p>

                    <h4>Example: Image of a man with a white cane walking with a guide dog</h4>

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <h5>Write</h5>
                    <p>“A man with a white cane walking with a guide dog.”</p></div>

                    <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <h5>Do Not Write</h5>
                    <p>“A blind man walking with a dog.”</p></div>

                <p>Follow the instructions on how to <a href="https://design.canada.ca/style-guide/#wp6-2:~:text=to%20organize%20data-,6.0%20Images%20and%20videos,-In%20this%20section">provide alt text for images</a> and how to add alt text using <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/video-improve-accessibility-with-alt-text-9c57ee44-bb48-40e3-aad4-7647fc1dba51">Microsoft 365</a>, and refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> tutorials for more information.</p></a>

                <h3>6.	Be Mindful of Screen Readers</h3>
                <p>Incorrect or insensitive language can lead to miscommunication, especially when screen readers are used. Using plain and respectful language ensures that the content is inclusive and accurately interpreted by low vision employees who rely on screen readers to access digital content.</p>

                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <div class="alert alert-danger">
                    <p>A website is describing a service as <strong>“helpful for the handicapped.”</strong> The term “handicapped” is outdated and considered offensive.</p> 
                    </div>
                    <p>A screen reader would read this aloud, which could potentially cause the employee to feel uncomfortable and misinterpret the message.</p>

                    <div class="alert alert-success">
                    <p>Instead, it would be best to use <strong>“helpful for persons with disabilities.”</strong></p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This is both accurate and respectful, ensuring that the message is inclusive and correctly interpreted by all.</p>

                <h3>7.	Stay Informed</h3>

                <p>Refer to Employment and Social Development Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/disability/arc/words-images.html#:~:text=accurately%20and%20confidently.-,Good%20words%20to%20choose,-Table%201%3A%20Good">A Way With Words And Images: Guide for Communicating With and About Persons With Disabilities</a> to support and refine your communications.</p>
