                <p>On September 10, 2024, delegates from <strong>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)</strong> visited the <strong>IT Accessibility Office (ITAO) – Accessibility Centre of Excellence (ACE)</strong> lab at 105 Rue Hôtel De Ville, Gatineau in the National Capital Region (NCR).</p>
                
                <p>The ITAO-ACE team was honoured to share their expertise with IRCC delegates on supporting IT accessibility through adaptive and assistive technologies at Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), while also providing best practices to enhance their own IT accessibility operations.</p>

                <p><strong>Titus Cristea, Manager of ACE</strong>, showcased the IT accessibility operations and services used to support ESDC employees. Highlights included:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to enhance accommodations for all employees, along with a demonstration on how our newly acquired 3D printer can help fulfill existing and future accommodation needs; and</li>
                    <li>demonstrations by ITAO loan bank services of various assistive and adaptive technologies, including ergonomic mice, keyboards, braille readers, monitors, smart pens, and speech recognition software like Dragon Naturally Speaking. </li>

                </ul>

                <p>IRCC acknowledged ITAO ACE’s commitment to integrate accessibility into their IT solution design process and the benefits of having a dedicated IT Accessibility Lab and Loan Bank that promote a culture of inclusivity, which drives research, innovation, user testing and compliance while improving user experience for all.</p>

                <p>IRCC expressed interest in collaborating with ACE to learn more about their processes, ways to speed up accommodation and procurement services, effectively implement innovative technologies and best practices. This collaboration not only enhances the shared vision of a more accessible and inclusive future, but also sets a precedent for fostering inclusive environments within other organizations.</p>
